🌺 About Me:

Discovering the world of data science began with a YouTuber sharing her life as a data analyst, sparking my curiosity about data's endless possibilities. Starting with a Coursera data analyst course, I dived deeper into a data science bootcamp.

During the bootcamp, machine learning caught my attention—seeing data predict outcomes was eye-opening. This motivated me to pursue further studies, and now, having completed the bootcamp, I'm eager to enhance my skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning.

Continued learning is my goal, and I'm excited to grow and contribute to the dynamic field of data science.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects to showcase my skills.
- 🌱 I'm actively honing my skills in Python, SQL, and broadening my expertise in Data Science!
- 😺 I'm a BIG cat lover!
- ☕️ I enjoy brewing coffee.
